# Create stunning images with DALL·E 3 with (Azure) OpenAI

![Header](./docs/header.webp)

This repository contains a simple console application written in .NET 8 to demonstrate how to create stunning images with [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and/or [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) using the [Azure.AI.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/) NuGet package.


## Usage

You need to create an OpenAI account on this [website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). You have to pay to use the API so make sure that you add your payment information. After that, you can create an API Key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for further use. If you have access to an Azure OpenAI instance you can also use this instance for the demo application.

Just run the app and follow the steps displayed on the screen.
